# A cables/wall gap protector for IKEA Bekant (17 mm)
This is my 3D design of a simple tool to protect a gap between the wall and the Bekant table that I've made to learn more about 123D Design.
I've published the final design on [Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2001983).

I've made the 3D design with 123D Design, mostly by drawing a 2D shape then extruding it, and also the subtract tool. The _Sketch Fillet_ tool was also very useful to make those rounded corners.

I've included my older designs as well. Here is the chronological order, starting from oldest to latest :

| Filename | Comment    |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| IKEA Bekant Wall Gap - square plan.123dx | This is my earliest design, before I rounded the corners. |
| IKEA Bekant Wall Gap - rounded plan.123dx | I added the rounded corners in this one using the _Sketch Fillet_ tool. |
| IKEA Bekant Wall Gap - rounded extrusion.123dx | I used the _Extrude_ tool to make the shape in 3D. I made it 10mm long then I exported it to STL (_See the next line below_). |
| IKEA Bekant Wall Gap Guide - test.stl | I printed this design. It was a nice fit for the thickness of the table (17mm) but I found it too easier to push it sideways and make it rotate. |
| IKEA Bekant Wall Gap - rounded plan V2.123dx | This is based on the original _IKEA Bekant Wall Gap - rounded plan.123dx_ but I added another 2D shape that I will later subtract to the original design. |
| IKEA Bekant Wall Gap - rounded extrusion V2.123dx | I made an extrusion of 30 mm to the original design and I extruded the second 2D shape to about 20 mm. I then did a subtract with the original design and the second design so to exclude some material so not the full 30 mm would touch the wall (only about 10 mm touch the wall). Finally, I used the _Fillet_ tool to create a bit more rounded corners. |
| IKEA Bekant Wall Gap Guide V2 - test.stl | This is the 3D printed test of the second version of my design. It turned out great and it wouldn't rotate when pushed sideways, which is what I wanted. =) |
| IKEA Bekant Wall Gap Protector.stl | This is the final version but it is the same as the previous above file. |
